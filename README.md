# State-space-search
Using the concept of state space search , I've written a C program to find all the possible solutions for the # jugs problem. There are 3 jugs , 8L , 5L , 3L. The 8L jug is filled with water till the brim and we need to find all possible solutions to bifurcate the water to 4L. The final state will be the 8L jug containing 4L of water and the 5L jug containing 4L of water.
